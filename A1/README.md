### Problem 1 - Creating a Shell

#### Instructions to run:

- The shell is written in C++. To build, simply use
`g++ -o myshell myshell.cpp`
and then 
- execute
`./myshell`

- Use `help` to display all the valid commands and their user manuals.

### Problem 3 â€“ Matrix Multiplication
- compile all programs with the command - 
	`g++ -o <name> <name.cpp> -lpthread`
- Running an individual program - 
		`./prog N`
		N : size of the matrix
- Generating the graph (using python and matplotlib)
		`python3 run.py` or `python run.py`
