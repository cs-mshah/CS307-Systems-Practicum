### Problem 3 â€“ Matrix Multiplication
- We are comparing the sequential program against 3 variants of parallelised matrix multiplication algorithms.
- A `mythreads.h` library has been included, which is basically a wrapper to some standard `pthread.h` library functions. The wrappers check for exception safety.
- **Variant 1** -
	- We create $n^2$ threads, each one computing one of the output element of the final product matrix.
- **Variant 2** -
	- We create $n$ threads, each one computing one row final product matrix.
- **Variant 3** -
	- We create 4 threads and use locks for computing the final product matrix.
	- Divide the first matrix into 4 quadrants. perform the sequential method with each quadrant with the 2nd matrix while holding a lock on the result of a partuicular element of the product matrix. 
	- The lock is needed as the other thread is also performing an addition on a shared variable result.
